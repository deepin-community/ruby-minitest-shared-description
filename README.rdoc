= minitest-shared_description

minitest-shared_description adds support for shared specs and shared spec subclasses
to Minitest.  Minitest supports shared specs by default using plain ruby modules, but
does not support shared spec subclasses.  In addition to making it possible to share
subclasses, minitest-shared_desciption also provides a slightly nicer interface for
sharing specs.

= Installation

  gem install minitest-shared_description

= Source Code

= Usage 

  require 'minitest/shared_description'

  SharedExamples = shared_description do
    # You can do regular specs
    it "should do something" do
      # something
    end

    # You can also have spec subclasses
    describe "nested specs" do
      # Called inside the before/after of the class that includes SharedExamples
      before {}
      after {}

      # Called inside the before/after of the class that includes SharedExamples
      # and the before/after in this class
      it "should do something else" do
        # something
      end
    end
  end

  describe "something" do
    include SharedExamples
  end

You can also have shared descriptions that are included in other shared descriptions:

  SharedExample1 = shared_description do
    describe "nested specs 1" do
      before {}
      after {}
      it "should do something" do end
    end
  end

  SharedExample2 = shared_description do
    describe "nested specs 2" do
      before {}
      after {}
      it "should do something else" do end
    end
  end

  SharedExamples = shared_description do
    # Include shared description in shared description block
    include SharedExample1

    describe "nested shared description use" do
      # Include shared description in shared description class
      include SharedExample2
    end
  end
