  minitest-shared_description adds support for shared specs and shared spec subclasses
  to Minitest.  Minitest supports shared specs by default using plain ruby modules, but
  does not support shared spec subclasses.  In addition to making it possible to share
  subclasses, minitest-shared_desciption also provides a slightly nicer interface for
  sharing specs.
